**SFEM ( Store Finance Exception Manager )** 
_August 2024 - Current_

**What is invoice / Open Receiving's Exception and Financial Reconciliation, problem, and the currecnt impact?**
- Invoice exceptions and financial reconciliation are critical processes that ensure financial accuracy in store-level transactions and help maintain timely supplier payments. At Walmart, we work with a variety of partners to procure products, including Direct Store Delivery (DSD) suppliers who deliver merchandise directly to our stores. Depending on the merchandise type or program, these suppliers may issue pre-charged invoices that are paid without confirming product receipt.

- In non-mainland regions, the current process is manual and paper-based-requiring store teams to review invoice exceptions, reconcile them against actual receipts, and take appropriate actions using the SMART screen. These actions may include submitting claims for incorrect charges, issuing credits, or correcting retail values. This reconciliation process ensures financial accuracy, helps avoid overpayments, and supports on-time payments to our supplier partners.

- Today, Walmart's non-mainland Regions (Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico - 36 stores) rely on manual, paper-based processes, and SMART screens to resolve these exceptions-a method that is both inefficient and error-prone. In fact, the resolution process often requires physical travel to remote locations, further compounding the issue. In FY24 alone, 20% of the ~402K exceptions reported in these regions took an average of 25-30 minutes each to resolve, compared to 12 minutes in mainland locations using modern tools. This not only delays supplier payments but also consumes valuable associate time. As Walmart transitions to a cloud-based system, the Store Finance Exception Management (SFEM) tool offers a centralized, Ul-driven solution that automates matching recommendation and streamlines exception resolution.

- This upgrade is expected to improve auto-matching to 96% using ERR platform and associate productivity by over 55%, dramatically reducing manual effort while ensuring timely and accurate financial reconciliation.
